1
00:00:02,289 --> 00:00:04,722
Space is the mirror of the soul.

2
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:08,960
Are we looking beyond,
or are we looking within?

3
00:00:08,962 --> 00:00:10,728
I'm looking at my shoes.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,131
This is making me a
little motion sick.

5
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:17,335
When we gaze out
at the immensities of space,

6
00:00:17,337 --> 00:00:19,304
we understand them
because there are immensities

7
00:00:19,306 --> 00:00:21,339
within us as well.

8
00:00:21,341 --> 00:00:22,874
I'm Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,

9
00:00:22,876 --> 00:00:27,112
and thank you
for taking a walk with me...

10
00:00:27,114 --> 00:00:28,780
through the stars.

11
00:00:31,284 --> 00:00:34,619
That pause gets
longer every show.

12
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:36,654
I believe...

13
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:38,289
you're right.

14
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:39,858
Hey.

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,059
Can I get a picture with you?

16
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:42,127
Absolutely.

17
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:44,229
And if you post it
on social media,

18
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:46,064
I suggest the hashtag
"Koothra-poet."

19
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:49,033
Thank you. The show was great.

20
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:50,235
Well, I can't take
all the credit.

21
00:00:50,237 --> 00:00:51,903
I have pretty good co-stars.

22
00:00:51,905 --> 00:00:54,706
The stars.

23
00:00:56,443 --> 00:00:58,543
Do you say that to everyone?

24
00:00:58,545 --> 00:00:59,944
Only to beautiful women.

25
00:00:59,946 --> 00:01:01,946
And okay women.

26
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:03,581
Okay.

27
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:06,151
Uh, just to clarify:
you're the first kind.

28
00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:07,485
Okay.

29
00:01:09,656 --> 00:01:10,855
Thanks for coming.

30
00:01:10,857 --> 00:01:13,024
What did you handsome
gentlemen think of the show?

31
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:14,592
Uh, you can turn it off now.

32
00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:18,630
It's sweet of you to say,

Look at this cute picture
of Halley in the bath.

44
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,558
Aw, that's great.

45
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,160
Want me to send it to you?

46
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:54,030
No, on your phone it's cute,
on my phone it's a crime.

47
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:59,035
I also have
a pretty cute picture to share.

48
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:00,369
What is that?

49
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,872
An equation.

50
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:03,873
Isn't it perfect?

51
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,708
Sometimes I just stare at it,

52
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,577
and I think "I can't believe
that came out of me."

53
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:10,913
Well, since
we're sharing pictures,

54
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:12,882
I have one to contribute.

55
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:15,851
Please don't let it be
you and your dog in the bathtub.

56
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:17,720
It's not.

57
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:19,689
But don't swipe.

58
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:23,092
What are we looking at here?

59
00:02:23,094 --> 00:02:25,428
Well, that's me
and a beautiful woman

60
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,332
and my watch showing the time
as 2:30 in the morning.

61
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:33,502
So, state's exhibit "A"?

62
00:02:33,504 --> 00:02:36,739
No. I met her at
the planetarium a few days ago,

63
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,941
and she invited me
out for a drink.

64
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:40,409
Oh, good for you. H-Hey,

65
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:41,944
w-what's the Hindi word
for "dog"?

66
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:43,913
<i>Kutta.</i>
You <i>kutta.</i>

67
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:45,981
<i>Bow-bow.</i>

68
00:02:47,285 --> 00:02:49,185
That's Hindi for woof-woof.

69
00:02:50,288 --> 00:02:53,022
I am seeing her again tonight.

70
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:54,457
You know, I also have
a date tonight.

71
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:56,492
But don't worry,
it's not another woman.

72
00:02:56,494 --> 00:02:59,228
It's string theory.

73
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,464
<i>Bow-bow.</i>

74
00:03:03,301 --> 00:03:06,535
Sorry, he's a
<i>kutta,</i> you're not.

75
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:12,141
Hi.
Hello.

76
00:03:12,143 --> 00:03:13,476
What you doing?

77
00:03:13,478 --> 00:03:17,380
Oh, taking another picture
with my baby.

78
00:03:17,382 --> 00:03:19,382
Look how big he got.

79
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:22,885
It's fun to see you
this excited.

80
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:23,953
Aw, thank you, that's so...

81
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,755
Don't sit there!
What, what?

82
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:26,889
I, uh-- sorry.

83
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:29,158
I-It's part of
my organization system.

84
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,993
That's-that's where
those papers go.

85
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:34,463
Okay. Um, how about if I just...

86
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:35,765
slide this notebook...

87
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:38,467
Eh...

88
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:39,602
You know what, it's fine.

89
00:03:39,604 --> 00:03:40,870
I'll just be in the bedroom.

90
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:43,372
No, no. Uh, this is
your apartment, too.

91
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:44,907
Uh, look, I'll-I'll stop
for the night

92
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:46,275
and clean this up.

93
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:48,344
Well, that's very considerate,
Sheldon.

94
00:03:48,346 --> 00:03:49,812
I know.

95
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,313
See, I'm trying
this new technique

96
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:54,417
where I imagine how I would feel
in someone else's position.

97
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,819
Y-You mean empathy?

98
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:59,288
Oh, I thought I came up with it.

99
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,358
Well, regardless,
I-I appreciate the effort.

100
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,459
Thank you.

101
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:04,760
It's really hard.

102
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:09,265
Morning.

103
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:11,133
Good morning.

104
00:04:11,135 --> 00:04:13,636
Aw, you didn't have
to cook me breakfast.

105
00:04:13,638 --> 00:04:15,504
Well, I wasn't sure
how I did last night,

106
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:18,107
and I wanted to finish strong.

107
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:20,242
You don't need to worry.

108
00:04:20,244 --> 00:04:21,544
Last night was great.

109
00:04:21,546 --> 00:04:24,346
Ah, well, you say that now,

110
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:29,351
but wait until you taste this.

111
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,854
Oh, my God, this is amazing.

112
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:34,557
Which is why I keep an omelet
pan in the trunk of my car.

113
00:04:36,594 --> 00:04:38,661
Well, thank you, it's delicious.

114
00:04:38,663 --> 00:04:40,729
My husband never cooked for me.

115
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:43,933
Oh, uh, y-you were married.

116
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:48,137
Yeah. Well, technically,
I guess I still am.

117
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:50,506
Is that "technically,"

118
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:52,208
like, the paperwork
hasn't gone through,

119
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,510
or "technically,"

120
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:58,247
like, he's in the closet
watching us right now?

121
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:01,450
No, no, we're separated.

122
00:05:01,452 --> 00:05:03,152
Do you mind if we talk
about something else?

123
00:05:03,154 --> 00:05:04,553
Of course.

124
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:08,157
Uh, you know, my secret to
making great omelets is that

125
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:09,859
I beat the egg whites
separately.

126
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:12,628
Speaking of which, how long
have you been separated?

127
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,231
About two weeks.

128
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:19,235
That is not a lot of weeks.

129
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:24,206
In fact, that's the bare minimum
to get to the plural "weeks."

130
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,141
Doesn't matter.

131
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,543
He moved out, I moved on.

132
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:28,978
Oh. Good.

133
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,180
Yeah, do you mind me asking
what he does for a living?

134
00:05:31,182 --> 00:05:32,615
He's a firefighter.

135
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:34,383
Oh. Interesting.

136
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:38,487
A potentially jealous man
who's handy with an ax.

137
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:40,623
It's-it's okay, though.

138
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:44,727
He's almost had two
weeks to cool down.

139
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,364
Okay, the next drug is Romatrol.

140
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:49,598
Oh, I know this one.

141
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,933
We're actually
pushing it really hard.

142
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:52,468
It treats mild dermatitis.

143
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,937
Uh, correct. And who can it
be prescribed to?

144
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:58,140
Adults and children
who have absolutely, for sure,

145
00:05:58,142 --> 00:06:00,276
stopped growing.

146
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:01,677
Right again.

147
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:03,546
And what are the side effects?

148
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:05,447
Oh, shoot, shoot.

149
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:06,916
Mm, remember the mnemonic.

150
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:08,884
Ah-- GRAVY, yes. G-R-A-V-Y.

151
00:06:08,886 --> 00:06:12,187
Okay, gastric distress,
redness, anal leakage,

152
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:16,091
vasculitis and yellow eyes.

153
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:17,893
Oh, uh, so close.

154
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:18,994
It's actually yellow discharge.

155
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:21,063
Oh, right.

156
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:24,233
That's why we went with "gravy."

157
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:26,535
Hello.

158
00:06:26,537 --> 00:06:27,636
Hey.
Hi.

159
00:06:33,444 --> 00:06:36,779
He knows he doesn't
live here anymore, right?

160
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:40,516
Maybe he's experiencing
memory loss because he took...

161
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:42,851
Flaxitrite.
Yeah.

162
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:45,254
- Thank you.
- Uh, Sheldon, what are you doing?

163
00:06:45,256 --> 00:06:47,556
Oh, I was just checking in
on my old room

164
00:06:47,558 --> 00:06:48,991
to see what you've done with it.

165
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:50,659
Why?

166
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,729
Well, I could use a place
to work in the evenings, and...

167
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:55,631
No.
Well, it's just that

168
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:57,433
there's not a lot of space in our apartment...
- No.

169
00:06:57,435 --> 00:06:59,335
Well, and I feel
like Amy's been having...

170
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:00,402
No.

171
00:07:00,404 --> 00:07:01,370
And since you're not...

172
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:02,738
No.

173
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,806
It's...

174
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:05,040
No.

175
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:08,077
No.

176
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,646
That is our room now,

177
00:07:10,648 --> 00:07:12,448
and we're gonna
turn it into a gym.

178
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,249
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

179
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:17,453
No.
No.

180
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,122
So I guess what's bugging me

181
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:21,957
is that they only broke up
13 days ago,

182
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,792
and now I'm dating her.

183
00:07:23,794 --> 00:07:25,194
So, am I, like,
the good guy in my movie,

184
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:26,695
or the bad guy in their movie?

185
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:29,898
Pretty sure you're
the weird friend in our movie.

186
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,301
I like her, okay?

187
00:07:32,303 --> 00:07:33,569
I just, I-I don't know
how I feel about

188
00:07:33,571 --> 00:07:35,604
being the third wheel
in a relationship.

189
00:07:35,606 --> 00:07:37,973
Says the guy in my bed
with my wife.

190
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:41,443
Guys, I mean,
he's around, okay?

191
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:43,479
He's apparently not happy
about the breakup,

192
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:45,414
and based on the sweatpants
he left at her place,

193
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,783
he's, like,
a medium to large man.

194
00:07:48,753 --> 00:07:51,220
Maybe those are
his "after the holiday" pants,

195
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:52,921
like you have.

196
00:07:53,858 --> 00:07:55,257
Oh, no. I mean, do you think

197
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:56,692
it's too soon
for her to be dating?

198
00:07:56,694 --> 00:07:58,027
If you and Bernadette broke up,

199
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:59,294
like, how long would you wait?

200
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:00,429
Oh, well, I don't even
want to think...

201
00:08:00,431 --> 00:08:01,597
Eight days.

202
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:04,433
What?

203
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:07,603
Two days to cry.
Six days to hit the gym.

204
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:10,105
First of all,
you already look amazing.

205
00:08:10,107 --> 00:08:11,573
Aw, that's sweet.

206
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,476
I'm gonna give him
an extra day of crying.

207
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:19,281
The answer is still no.

208
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:25,621
You can say we wouldn't know
you're here, but we'd know.

209
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:29,391
Because you'd be here!

210
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:33,762
So, who was that?

211
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:36,432
I can't believe
you hung up on me!

212
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:39,702
What the hell?

213
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:41,704
What are you doing here?

214
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:42,971
I am proving you wrong.

215
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:44,339
I've been working
back there for hours.

216
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:46,008
You had no idea.

217
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,077
Do something.

218
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:51,346
What the hell?
What are you doing here?

219
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:52,948
I-I am trying to respect Amy.

220
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,216
Okay, look,

221
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:56,118
you have an office at work.
Why don't you go there?

222
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,954
I can't go to the office every
time I have a brilliant thought.

223
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,055
I'd basically be living there.

224
00:09:00,057 --> 00:09:02,191
Sounds good, do that.
Yeah...

225
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:04,593
No. No, the campus
isn't safe at night.

226
00:09:04,595 --> 00:09:06,662
There's raccoons and
undergrads just walking around

227
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:08,764
like they own the place.

228
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:10,099
Look.

229
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:11,667
I need somewhere to work
in the evenings.

230
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:13,102
You have a space
you aren't using.

231
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:16,572
Just take a look at my proposal.

232
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,774
What is this?

233
00:09:18,776 --> 00:09:19,742
A rental agreement.

234
00:09:19,744 --> 00:09:21,443
I will only use
the room for work.

235
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:23,445
I-I won't sleep here,
I won't eat your food,

236
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:24,680
I won't even use your bathroom.

237
00:09:24,682 --> 00:09:27,816
So you can just walk in any
time of the day or night?

238
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,351
Well, he does that now.

239
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:31,086
At least this way
we'll get paid.

240
00:09:33,424 --> 00:09:35,924
I am Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,

241
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:38,827
and thank you
for taking a walk with me...

242
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:43,198
...through the stars.

243
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:48,003
I-I think that one was too long.

244
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,005
Yeah, you're right.
I totally felt it.

245
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,106
Should we, uh, run it again?

246
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:53,175
Please, God, no.

247
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:56,011
- Hey.
- Hey.

248
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,980
Can I help you?

249
00:09:57,982 --> 00:09:59,815
Which one of you
is Rajesh Koothrappali?

250
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:01,517
Really? You're not sure

251
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,620
which one of us is
Rajesh Koothrappali?

252
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:09,224
I am. I was just trying
not to be racist.

253
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:13,595
I'm Nell's husband.

254
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:18,033
Oh, uh...

255
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,302
h-here's the thing--
I didn't know

256
00:10:20,304 --> 00:10:22,538
that she was married
until after...

257
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,906
After what?

258
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,577
I'm...

259
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:30,279
I'm really sorry.

260
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:32,114
Well, that doesn't
make me feel better.

261
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:33,882
Wh-What would make
you feel better?

262
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,517
I want you to stop
seeing my wife.

263
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,052
Done. Nice to
meet you. Bye.

264
00:10:39,123 --> 00:10:41,623
What am I gonna do?

265
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:52,034
Hey, buddy,
do-do you want to talk?

266
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:55,804
I thought we were
gonna start a family.

267
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:58,774
Next thing I
know, it's over.

268
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:02,110
It's gonna be okay.

269
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:03,612
How is it gonna be okay?

270
00:11:03,614 --> 00:11:06,982
You're sleeping
with my wife.

271
00:11:06,984 --> 00:11:10,285
I mean, besides that.

272
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:18,225
Can I get you anything?

273
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:19,760
A glass of water?

274
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,396
A laser show?

275
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:24,064
No, thank you.
Oh, good.

276
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:26,901
'Cause I don't, I don't
even know how to turn it on.

277
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:28,168
I'm sorry.

278
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,038
I shouldn't
have come here.

279
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,542
I guess I just wanted to see
who she replaced me with.

280
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:36,343
Don't say that.

281
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:37,978
What you two had
was special.

282
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,446
No one can replace you.

283
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,581
Did she say that?

284
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,049
No.

285
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:45,352
I should go, right?

286
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:46,554
Stay.

287
00:11:46,556 --> 00:11:49,623
Okay, I'll
call you later.

288
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,859
Look, if it makes you
feel any better,

289
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:53,794
I barely know her.

290
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,230
And she had sex with you?

291
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:59,199
Nell tells me
you're a fireman.

292
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:00,668
What's that like?

293
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,979
Okay, I-I-I'm really
uncomfortable

294
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,280
with him back in that room.

295
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:15,249
Why? He hasn't made
a peep all day.

296
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:16,216
Y-Y-You don't get it.

297
00:12:16,218 --> 00:12:18,152
All the years
that we lived together,

298
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,387
he drove me crazy
the whole time.

299
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:22,590
And now he's not.

300
00:12:22,592 --> 00:12:25,392
Exactly.

301
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:27,595
D-Don't look at me like that.

302
00:12:27,597 --> 00:12:29,897
It-it-it means he did it
on purpose.

303
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:31,966
It was a choice.

304
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:34,835
That-That's like finding out
Godzilla could've had Arby's

305
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,204
instead of Tokyo.

306
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:40,407
I don't think
they have Arby's in Japan.

307
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:42,876
Not my point.

308
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:46,614
Sheldon.

309
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:48,015
Sheldon!

310
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:52,252
I'm sorry. Am I
being too loud?

311
00:12:52,254 --> 00:12:55,222
No, you're being perfect
and you know it.

312
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:59,159
Would you like me to be a
less considerate tenant?

313
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:01,528
No. Yes. What...?

314
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,030
Stop messing with me!

315
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:07,301
Hey, I was wrong.

316
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:10,404
There's an Arby's in Okinawa.

317
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:16,810
He was best friends
with her older brother,

318
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:18,078
but he didn't
even notice her.

319
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,346
And then years afterward,

320
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:21,782
they randomly bumped into
each other at the DMV.

321
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:23,917
Two hours later,
they were in love.

322
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,622
You can really see the sparkle
in his license photo.

323
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,791
He told you all this
at the planetarium?

324
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:32,493
No, no, we went
to House of Pies.

325
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:34,061
He got banana cream.
I got coconut.

326
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,863
We did halfsies.

327
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:38,832
You did pie halfsies
with another man?

328
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:41,969
You mean other than you?

329
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:45,105
Yeah.

330
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:48,308
I feel bad for
him, Bernie.

331
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,643
He's a, he's a good guy.

332
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:51,145
Well, if you're uncomfortable
with it,

333
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:52,980
maybe stop sleeping
with his wife.

334
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:54,281
I don't think the sex
is the problem.

335
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:56,850
I know for a fact
I was just okay.

336
00:13:57,953 --> 00:13:59,186
For the record, I'm the one

337
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:01,188
who introduced you
to House of Pies.

338
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:05,192
Sheldon?

339
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:06,794
Oh, Leonard.

340
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:09,797
Sorry, I just, I had
to get out of there.

341
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,331
What did he do now?

342
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,467
Nothing. He's being a dream.

343
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:16,603
Don't give me that look.

344
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,472
That's how Penny looked at me.
I'm not crazy.

345
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:21,008
Penny and I have the same
"You're crazy" look?

346
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,476
That's kind of sweet.

347
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:26,213
I know how to deal with
Sheldon being Sheldon,

348
00:14:26,215 --> 00:14:29,483
but Sheldon being a-a
rational, thoughtful person?

349
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:31,585
I'm clueless.
I-It's like

350
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:33,954
when my mom called last year
to sing happy birthday

351
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,623
and I-I just threw up.

352
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:38,892
Well, if it gets
to be too much,

353
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:40,828
you can always send him
back over here.

354
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,196
I made a deal with him,

355
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:43,664
and besides, that
wouldn't be fair to you.

356
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,399
Well, actually, I miss him.

357
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:46,400
He's been over there a lot.

358
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:49,570
Well, great.
Tell him he can come back.

359
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:51,538
I can't. He's thinking of me
and my feelings

360
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,107
and trying to be respectful.

361
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,843
That's what he's doing
to me, too, the jerk!

362
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:58,545
Stop that.

363
00:14:58,547 --> 00:15:03,751
Hey, your mad look and Sheldon's
constipated look are the same.

364
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:11,859
This is nice.

365
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:13,026
It is.

366
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:17,898
She used to kiss me
like that.

367
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:20,267
You okay?

368
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:24,204
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.

369
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:26,406
Yeah.

370
00:15:28,811 --> 00:15:30,544
Oh, God,
I'm so alone.

371
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:32,246
Sorry, I can't do this.

372
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:34,248
What's going on?

373
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,483
I met Oliver the other day.

374
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:39,219
Wait, you tracked down
my husband?

375
00:15:39,221 --> 00:15:40,854
No, that would be weird.

376
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,690
He tracked me down, then we
spent the evening together.

377
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:46,360
I don't believe this.

378
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,963
He-he only did it
because he cares about you.

379
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:52,900
No, he did it because he's
possessive and jealous.

380
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:54,101
Really?
I didn't get that at all.

381
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:56,103
He made me feel
very comfortable.

382
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:58,705
Well, I'm glad you
two hit it off.

383
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:02,075
You know, I don't think that
you're being very fair to him.

384
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:04,011
You're taking his side?

385
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:06,480
No, but I should point out
that he did offer

386
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:09,616
to go to counseling, so at least
one of you is trying.

387
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:12,519
You're crazier than he is.

388
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:15,422
I'll tell you what, just
give him one more chance

389
00:16:15,424 --> 00:16:16,523
and if it doesn't work out,

390
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:19,526
I'll be happy to keep
sleeping with you.

391
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:21,995
You would?

392
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,833
Either way, you've
got yourself a fella.

393
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:27,935
Like, how nice is that?

394
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:33,640
Hey, Sheldon.

395
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:38,312
Hello.
Hey.

396
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:41,582
So, your contract provides
for a three-day trial period,

397
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,917
and I don't think
this is working out.

398
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,452
So, to put it
in legal terms,

399
00:16:45,454 --> 00:16:47,721
the party of the first part
would like

400
00:16:47,723 --> 00:16:50,791
the party of the second part
to get out.

401
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:53,694
What time does the
trial period end?

402
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:55,429
12:00, noon.

403
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,498
Yeah-- what does
it say after that?

404
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:04,438
Eastern Standard Time.

405
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,641
That was three hours ago.

406
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:09,376
And, uh, since you
didn't exercise

407
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:13,780
your right to revoke, I
exercised my right to extend,

408
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:18,318
triggering this long-form
rental agreement...

409
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,889
...of which you're
already in violation.

410
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:24,691
This is just
a-a bunch of paper.

411
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:25,993
You can't enforce this.

412
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:28,996
Hire a lawyer.
Let's find out.

413
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:31,698
This is not happening.

414
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,900
Be that as it may,

415
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:34,968
page nine says that
you have to provide me

416
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,472
with lemon-flavored sparkling
waters, so... chop-chop.

417
00:17:43,712 --> 00:17:44,811
Hey, how'd it go?

418
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,980
Well, apparently
he's not leaving

419
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:50,284
and I have to go get him
sparkling water.

420
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:51,985
Why are you smiling?

421
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:55,489
I don't know.
It just feels right.

422
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,399
...to the stars.

423
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:10,838
Hey.

424
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,574
Hey, buddy.

425
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:14,775
I talked to Nell.

426
00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:16,377
She was pretty upset
after you left.

427
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:19,713
Yeah, I'm sorry.
No. No, no, no.

428
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:21,382
She told me that you said
something so creepy

429
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:24,151
that I seemed great
in comparison.

430
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:26,086
I know exactly what it was.

431
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:27,254
I... no, actually,

432
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:28,622
there was a couple of
things it could've been.

433
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:31,992
Whichever one it
was, it was creepy.

434
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:33,661
Anyway, uh, I went over
to comfort her,

435
00:18:33,663 --> 00:18:37,197
and we talked, and I think we're
gonna give it another chance.

436
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,100
I am so happy for you!
Hey-hey-hey.

437
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:42,703
Hey, uh, we should celebrate.

438
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:43,804
House of Pies?

439
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:45,439
You know it.

440
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,144
Should we invite Nell?

441
00:18:50,146 --> 00:18:52,246
- Do we have to?
- Nah.
