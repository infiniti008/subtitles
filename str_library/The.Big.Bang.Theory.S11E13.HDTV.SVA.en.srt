1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,831
Hey! Look what I got everybody.

2
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:09,069
Newspapers? Did you find
a portal back to the 1990s?

3
00:00:10,372 --> 00:00:12,606
No. If he had that,
he'd be trying to prevent NSYNC

4
00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:14,240
from breaking up.

5
00:00:14,242 --> 00:00:15,976
Oh, please.
I'm glad they broke up.

6
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:18,678
Otherwise, Justin would
never have brought sexy back.

7
00:00:19,848 --> 00:00:22,248
One thing you can't get
on an iPad,

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,818
the smell of ink and paper.

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,220
One more reason
iPads are better.

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,390
They reviewed
my planetarium show.

11
00:00:30,392 --> 00:00:33,293
Yeah. It's on page three
of the Arts and Leisure section.

12
00:00:41,203 --> 00:00:43,770
Oh, look, they still
have <i>Far Side.</i>

13
00:00:43,772 --> 00:00:45,739
Oh, I don't
get that one.

14
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:48,608
Oh, he's pushing
when he should be pulling.

15
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,946
Hmm. I don't think he belongs
in that gifted school, then.

16
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:54,748
What are you doing?
Making a boat.

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,850
When I was a kid,
my dad showed me how.

18
00:00:56,852 --> 00:00:59,719
Boy, you'll do anything
to avoid reading.

19
00:01:01,056 --> 00:01:03,056
Guys, it's under
“Things to do this weekend.”

20
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:04,858
I can't find it.
What does it say?

21
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,128
That it's a thing
to do this weekend.

22
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,930
That's great, Raj.
Congratulations.

23
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:12,098
You know, while we're bragging,

24
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,733
<i>The Journal</i>
<i>of Prosthetic Medicine</i>

25
00:01:13,735 --> 00:01:15,969
just wrote up the project that
Howard and I are working on.

26
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:18,104
Well, you didn't
tell me that.

27
00:01:18,106 --> 00:01:20,340
Oh, it just came out.
It's just a little blurb.

28
00:01:20,342 --> 00:01:22,409
Oh, well, good for you.

29
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:24,644
You know, Bert and I have
started isolating zircons

30
00:01:24,646 --> 00:01:27,113
from meteorites
for our dark matter search.

31
00:01:27,115 --> 00:01:28,481
Oh. Well, how nice.

32
00:01:28,483 --> 00:01:29,916
Everyone's doing
impressive work.

33
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:31,651
What have you been
working on these days?

34
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:34,454
Whoa, whoa. Where'd
that come from?

35
00:01:34,456 --> 00:01:36,523
Where did what come from?

36
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:37,824
I try to be supportive,

37
00:01:37,826 --> 00:01:41,227
and you break out the hot
lights and the rubber hose.

38
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:42,896
I just asked
what you've been working on.

39
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:44,864
Oh, my God, let it go.

40
00:01:44,866 --> 00:01:46,332
Do you believe this guy?

41
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:49,135
I did it!

42
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:53,606
See? It's a... it's a boat.

43
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,978
It's also a hat.

00:02:24,613 --> 00:02:26,980
Okay, how do you want
to play this?

55
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:29,149
Do you want to pretend like
nothing's bothering you

56
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:31,184
and blow up later,
or do you just want to be

57
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:33,120
a maniac right now?

58
00:02:33,122 --> 00:02:36,189
Nothing is bothering me.

59
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:38,158
Fine. Be that way.

60
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,362
If you want to talk,
I'll be flushing my sinuses.

61
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:44,197
Wait.

62
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,866
I have a confession.

63
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:48,568
When I berated Leonard,

64
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,438
it was a clever ruse
to conceal the fact

65
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,640
that I'm not
working on anything.

66
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:56,143
Well, I think
I speak for everyone

67
00:02:56,145 --> 00:02:59,346
when I say, “No!”

68
00:02:59,348 --> 00:03:03,517
The truth is I have
nothing of interest to pursue.

69
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,752
Well, maybe this is
the perfect opportunity

70
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:08,588
to take some time
for yourself and refocus.

71
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,658
I'm sure you'll find something
you're excited about.

72
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,326
Thank you, Amy.

73
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:15,729
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

74
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:19,533
Hey, can I stay here?
Sheldon kicked me out.

75
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:21,635
Well, is everything okay?

76
00:03:21,637 --> 00:03:24,337
Yeah. He just wants
some alone time to work.

77
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:25,472
Fine.
Make yourself at home.

78
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:27,007
Yeah. We were just about
to watch a little TV.

79
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:28,108
You're welcome
to join us.

80
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,342
Thanks. I'll be right with you.

81
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:31,745
I just have to, uh,
do my neti pot.

82
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:44,191
So what are you guys
gonna watch?

83
00:03:46,762 --> 00:03:48,395
Okay.

84
00:03:48,397 --> 00:03:50,831
Hey, uh, what do you think
we should open our show with?

85
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:55,735
Uh, “Thor and Doctor Jones”
or “Let's Get Astrophysical”?

86
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:57,804
I don't know. I think
we should start with something

87
00:03:57,806 --> 00:03:59,239
that gets them up on their feet.

88
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:02,008
Maybe
“Sherlock Around the Clock.”

89
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,344
Great, yeah.
Uh, let's give it a try.

90
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:09,749
Halley's napping! Keep it down!

91
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:11,485
Oh. Right. Sorry.

92
00:04:11,487 --> 00:04:14,855
It's cool.
We don't need volume to rock.

93
00:04:14,857 --> 00:04:17,023
Instead of blowing
the roof off this place,

94
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:18,725
we can gently lift it off

95
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:21,394
and set it quietly down
in the backyard.

96
00:04:22,297 --> 00:04:23,563
Okay.

97
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:25,132
One, two, three, four.

98
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:28,935
♪ Holmes said to Watson ♪

99
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:30,537
♪ On Baker Street ♪

100
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:32,172
♪ Come on, Doctor ♪

00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:34,107
♪ Time to move them feet ♪

102
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:36,009
Sing it with us.

103
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:38,011
♪ Sherlock, Sherlock ♪

104
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:39,746
♪ Sherlock around the clock ♪

105
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:41,214
We can't hear you.

106

107
00:04:43,018 --> 00:04:45,218

108
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:49,589
Nice going.

109
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:51,591
Sorry. Sorry. I'll get her.

110
00:04:51,593 --> 00:04:53,460
One sec.

111
00:04:54,863 --> 00:04:57,631
You bought diapers, right?

112
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,901
Be right back.

113
00:05:00,903 --> 00:05:03,203
Rock and roll!

114
00:05:05,941 --> 00:05:08,808
Okay. Scratch paper, check.

115
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,877
Whiteboard, check.

116
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,247
Chex Mix, check.

117
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:17,350
And here we go.

118
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,354
Oh, dang it.

119
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:22,889
Hello, Mother.

120
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:24,824
Hi there, Shelly.
You will never believe

121
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:27,727
who I ran into
at the barbecue festival.

122
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:30,297
I am right in the middle
of some very important work.

123
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:32,299
I don't have time for this
right now.

124
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:34,501
Then why did you
answer the phone?

125
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:36,670
Because you raised me
to be polite.

126
00:05:36,672 --> 00:05:38,471
Now stop bothering me.

127
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,403
Hello again.

128
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:13,473
Who did you see
at the barbecue festival?

129
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:15,442
Mr. Watkins.

130
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:16,743
Really?

131
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:19,112
You called me and interrupted
my work to tell me

132
00:06:19,114 --> 00:06:21,848
that you ran into somebody
you could plausibly run into?

133
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,217
I'm sorry, Mother,
I really need to focus here.

134
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:25,852
I will speak to you next week.

135
00:06:25,854 --> 00:06:28,054
Okay, sweetheart.
I'll talk to you then.

136
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:40,600
I thought Mr. Watkins
moved to Florida.

137
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:44,137
He did.
He was back visiting his son.

138
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:46,306
Oh, gosh darn it,
that is interesting.

139
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:48,074
Was it Tommy or Joe?

140
00:06:48,076 --> 00:06:50,577
I bet it was Joe, 'cause
he and Tommy had a falling out

141
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:52,746
over that time-share.

142
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:56,483
You guys do anything
fun after dinner?

143
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:58,918
Well, actually Amy came
back over and we hung out.

144
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,087
Did you know that we're both
spelling bee champs?

145
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:04,691
We stayed up for hours
trying to stump each other.

146
00:07:04,693 --> 00:07:06,359
Who won?

147
00:07:06,361 --> 00:07:08,828
Oh, she thought she had me
with “appoggiatura,”

148
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,098
but I shut that down
expeditiously.

149
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,701
E-X-P-E-D-I-T-I-O-U-S-L-Y.

150
00:07:14,703 --> 00:07:16,836
Expeditiously.

151
00:07:16,838 --> 00:07:21,141
Wow. I bet that made Penny
take off all of her clothes.

152
00:07:22,544 --> 00:07:25,612
Put her pajamas on and
then go to bed early.

153
00:07:25,614 --> 00:07:27,580
At, like, 9:00.
Yeah.

154
00:07:27,582 --> 00:07:30,116
- Hey. - Hey.
- Hey.

155
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:32,085
Oh, are we still on
for band practice this evening?

156
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:33,553
Oh, shoot.

157
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:36,589
I promised I would take Halley
over to Bernadette's parents.

158
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:38,235
Dude, the gig is,
like, next weekend.

159
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:39,260
I know.

160
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:41,461
I'm sorry.
I really want to do this,

161
00:07:41,463 --> 00:07:43,963
but I just don't think
I have the time.

162
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:46,700
Okay. I-I guess
I'll have to cancel.

163
00:07:46,702 --> 00:07:50,003
Toby Greenbaum will have to
become a man without us.

164
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:52,439
Too bad, you guys
kill at bar mitzvahs.

165
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:55,275
And other events that
people can't leave.

166
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:59,979
I don't want to be the one
who breaks up the band.

167
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:02,615
You know, maybe you should...

168
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:04,417
think about replacing me.

169
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,486
Okay.
I mean,

170
00:08:06,488 --> 00:08:09,522
I know it'll be hard since we...

171
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:11,524
Oh, I bet Bert could do it.
He plays guitar.

172
00:08:11,526 --> 00:08:12,759
I'm gonna go ask him.

173
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:19,366
I guess he forgot that
I play the cello.

174
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:22,869
I-I don't think he did.

175
00:08:24,106 --> 00:08:26,039
Okay, I think it's ready.

176
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,874
Should we put on
safety goggles?

177
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:31,578
Well, the funnest fun
is the safest fun, so yes.

178
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,712
Hey.

179
00:08:32,714 --> 00:08:33,747
Hi.
Hello.

180
00:08:33,749 --> 00:08:36,716
Oh, Amy, you're here... again.

181
00:08:36,718 --> 00:08:38,651
Yeah, Sheldon said he needed
another night to work,

182
00:08:38,653 --> 00:08:40,453
so I said I'd give him
some space.

183
00:08:40,455 --> 00:08:41,821
So what's all this?

184
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:44,491
Well, Amy and I were talking
about old science fair projects,

185
00:08:44,493 --> 00:08:46,192
and how fun it would be
to recreate them.

186
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:47,727
We're making hot ice.

187
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:48,895
Mm-hmm. It's pretty cool.

188
00:08:48,897 --> 00:08:51,264
Nice one.
Yeah.

189
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:52,599
Turns out we both

190
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:55,368
did this as our science fair
projects in ninth grade.

191
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,170
Do you remember any of
your high school projects?

192
00:08:57,172 --> 00:09:00,740
Uh, well, I remember
telling Jenny Runyon

193
00:09:00,742 --> 00:09:02,942
that I would teach her
how to flirt with boys

194
00:09:02,944 --> 00:09:04,577
if she put my name
on her project.

195
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:08,848
I got an “A,” she got pregnant.

196
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,751
Girls like you are why I had to
come straight home after school.

197
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:15,722
Check this out.

198
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:19,793
Wow, that's amazing.

199
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:21,060
Mm-hmm.

200
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:23,096
The crystallization is
an exothermic process,

201
00:09:23,098 --> 00:09:24,597
so the ice is actually hot.

202
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:26,699
I won first place for this.
So did I.

203
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:28,968
I threw Jenny's baby shower.

204
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,337
Oh, hey, in seventh grade,

205
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:32,872
I built a cobra wave.
You want to do that?

206
00:09:32,874 --> 00:09:35,275
Oh, we can come up with
a wave speed formula,

207
00:09:35,277 --> 00:09:37,544
and see how accurately
we can predict the amplitude.

208
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:39,212
Wow, I didn't think
anything could top

209
00:09:39,214 --> 00:09:42,482
last night's spelling bee,
but here comes math.

210
00:09:42,484 --> 00:09:45,151
I'm sorry, we-we don't
have to do more experiments.

211
00:09:45,153 --> 00:09:47,120
Let's do something
we can all enjoy.

212
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:49,689
Hey, uh, you want to watch
that show you like

213
00:09:49,691 --> 00:09:52,792
where people want to buy a house
and then they do?

214
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:54,994
No, no, you guys do
your experiments.

215
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:55,995
I'll go pick up dinner.

216
00:09:55,997 --> 00:09:56,930
Are you sure?

217
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:58,097
Yeah, you're having science fun,

218
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:01,668
and I don't want to interfere,
or watch you.

219
00:10:09,377 --> 00:10:11,511
Did I actually do it?

220
00:10:11,513 --> 00:10:15,682
I did. I did.

221
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,321
The answer is one in 18 million.

222
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:23,223
What is?

223
00:10:23,225 --> 00:10:26,559
The odds of you
running into Mr. Watkins.

224
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:28,962
Oh, Shelly.
I have bad news.

225
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:31,364
Mr. Watkins passed this morning.

226
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:33,233
Oh.

227
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:35,368
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

228
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,804
I know.
What are the odds of that?

229
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:40,073
Call you back.

230
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:47,089
Now let's
calculate the amplitude!

231
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:49,325
All right!

232
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,134
Sheldon? Sheldon? Sheldon?

233
00:11:00,838 --> 00:11:03,372
It's annoying
when you do it.

234
00:11:03,374 --> 00:11:05,474
I brought pizza.

235
00:11:05,476 --> 00:11:07,009
Oh, thank you.

236
00:11:07,011 --> 00:11:09,078
I have been working
pretty hard.

237
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,346
I-I could use a break.

238
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:11,847
What's that?

239
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:13,883
Oh, yeah, that is an experiment

240
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:16,452
to see how many parallelograms
I could draw

241
00:11:16,454 --> 00:11:18,421
while holding my breath.

242
00:11:19,524 --> 00:11:22,225
Is that where you blacked out?

243
00:11:22,227 --> 00:11:23,693
No, actually,

244
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:26,862
<i>that's</i> where
I blacked out.

245
00:11:26,864 --> 00:11:28,264
And this?

246
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:29,665
That is a list

247
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:32,868
of all the different types
of natural disasters.

248
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,570
“Fire-quake”?

249
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:37,073
I made that one up.

250
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:40,710
Which I shouldn't have,
because now I'm scared of it.

251
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:43,379
Hey, I thought you were
working on actual science.

252
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:44,847
I am.

253
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:47,283
I'm trying to come up with
a new approach to dark matter,

254
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:49,118
but people keep
distracting me.

255
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,754
First, my mother kept answering
the phone when I called,

256
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:53,389
even though she knew I was busy.

257
00:11:53,391 --> 00:11:56,225
And now you show up
with my favorite shape of food--

258
00:11:56,227 --> 00:12:00,529
a circle made of triangles
served in a square box.

259
00:12:00,531 --> 00:12:02,331
Maybe I'll just eat this
in the laundry room.

260
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,599
No, no. Wait.

261
00:12:03,601 --> 00:12:04,867
You don't have to go,

262
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:07,236
as long as you sit quietly
and don't say anything.

263
00:12:07,238 --> 00:12:09,438
Fine.

264
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,178
Mmm.

265
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,681
Good.
Mmm.

266
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:23,753
Are you mocking me?

267
00:12:28,726 --> 00:12:32,395
Hey, you want to hear
one of my geology songs?

268
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:34,430
So it's about rocks?

269
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:37,133
Better. It's about a boulder.

270
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:39,035
Isn't that the same thing?

271
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:40,469
Far from it.

272
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:44,573
A boulder has a diameter
greater than 25.6 centimeters.

273
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:46,509
Is that fact in the song?

274
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:47,643
No.

275
00:12:48,246 --> 00:12:50,146
Yes.

276
00:12:51,716 --> 00:12:53,749
It's sung from the viewpoint
of the boulder

277
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:55,584
that chases Indiana Jones.

278
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:57,853
That's right up our alley.
Let's hear it.

279
00:12:57,855 --> 00:12:58,854
Okay.

280
00:13:01,326 --> 00:13:05,428

281
00:13:06,664 --> 00:13:09,965

291
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:38,160
So, I think if we want

292
00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:40,896
to predict the height
of the wave, we need to use

293
00:13:40,898 --> 00:13:43,332
elasticity theory
and model the lattice

294
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:45,334
as one continuous
flexible piece.

295
00:13:45,336 --> 00:13:46,869
This is fun.
Mm-hmm.

296
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:48,838
Playing with Popsicle sticks,

297
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,207
exploring ways
to store kinetic energy.

298
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:53,776
It's like preschool
all over again.

299
00:13:53,778 --> 00:13:56,512
Except now if I eat paste,
it's because I want to,

300
00:13:56,514 --> 00:13:59,515
not because
Craig Schultz is making me.

301
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:01,951
Hey, can I ask you a question?

302
00:14:01,953 --> 00:14:03,486
Is it, “Where was the teacher?”

303
00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:06,555
She was in the bathroom smoking,
that's where.

304
00:14:06,557 --> 00:14:09,658
It wasn't, but I'm glad
to see you've moved on.

305
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:13,696
I was gonna ask if being married
felt any different.

306
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:17,266
Oh. Uh... not really.

307
00:14:17,268 --> 00:14:20,102
Sorry. That probably wasn't
the answer you were looking for.

308
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:21,570
No, actually it is.

309
00:14:21,572 --> 00:14:24,840
I mean, Sheldon and I are in
a really great place right now,

310
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:27,576
and I just, I don't want
anything to mess that up.

311
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:29,645
Mm-hmm.
You do remember you're here

312
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:32,715
because he kicked you
out of your apartment?

313
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:34,049
Yes.

314
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:36,018
His work is important to him.

315
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,120
It's one of the
things I find

316
00:14:38,122 --> 00:14:39,522
the sexiest about him.

317
00:14:39,524 --> 00:14:42,124
Well, that and...
Aah!

318
00:14:47,598 --> 00:14:49,632
...his butt.

319
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:53,669
And then I was
thinking about

320
00:14:53,671 --> 00:14:55,738
inventing a new
dark matter particle

321
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,640
to evade the omega
baryon constraints,

322
00:14:57,642 --> 00:14:59,275
but that just seems
like something

323
00:14:59,277 --> 00:15:00,876
anyone could
come up with.

324
00:15:00,878 --> 00:15:03,145
Mm. Agreed.

325
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:06,515
You know
what's blowing my mind?

326
00:15:06,517 --> 00:15:11,220
Somebody thought about
putting cheese in this crust.

327
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:15,658
I just wish I could find
something that excites me.

328
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,760
You do understand
that crust doesn't normally

329
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:19,395
come with cheese in it?

330
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:22,298
Okay, all right, look.

331
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,867
What got you excited about
dark matter in the first place?

332
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:28,437
Well, I left
string theory,

333
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:30,339
which I'd been working
on for a long time,

334
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:32,908
and everyone was talking about
how cool dark matter was,

335
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,078
and I thought, “Well, sure,
I'll give that a whirl”"

336
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,648
So it's your rebound science?

337
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,150
What's that?

338
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:44,253
Well, not the science you spend
the rest of your life with,

339
00:15:44,255 --> 00:15:47,823
but the one you use to make
yourself feel pretty again.

340
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:51,393
Well, if I'm being honest,

341
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:53,462
I never forgot about
string theory.

342
00:15:53,464 --> 00:15:55,297
It's remarkable.

343
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:57,733
It's the closest we've come
to a theory of everything,

344
00:15:57,735 --> 00:16:00,269
something even Einstein
couldn't figure out.

345
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:04,240
Well, if he couldn't figure
it out, maybe it's just wrong.

346
00:16:04,242 --> 00:16:05,908
But it's so elegant.

347
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,512
I mean, look,
string theory posits

348
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:12,114
that the fundamental particles
we see in three dimensions

349
00:16:12,116 --> 00:16:17,653
are actually strings embedded
in multidimensional space-time.

350
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:21,423
Interesting.

351
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:23,993
So that would mean...

352
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:26,161
that...

353
00:16:27,498 --> 00:16:29,665
Can't do this by myself, buddy.

354
00:16:39,577 --> 00:16:42,545
What is happening?

355
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:45,047
I was trying
not to wake you.

356
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:47,416
Did it work?

357
00:16:47,418 --> 00:16:49,285
Sorry.

358
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:51,020
I just realized,

359
00:16:51,022 --> 00:16:54,990
now that I'm not in the band,
I can focus on my own music.

360
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:57,960
You know? Go solo.

361
00:16:57,962 --> 00:17:00,696
You said you were
taking a break from the band

362
00:17:00,698 --> 00:17:02,498
to help with me and the baby.

363
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,101
Yes, and write
an astronaut musical.

364
00:17:06,103 --> 00:17:08,637
Picture this.
The curtain opens.

365
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:10,706
There's a lone astronaut
floating

366
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,408
in the inky blackness
of space.

367
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,443
Maybe wires, maybe fog.

368
00:17:14,445 --> 00:17:16,712
I'll let the director
figure that out.

369
00:17:16,714 --> 00:17:21,050
♪ I really don't know when ♪

370
00:17:21,052 --> 00:17:26,789
♪ I'll run out of oxy... gen. ♪

371
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:31,093
Good news!
I'm back in the band!

372
00:17:31,095 --> 00:17:33,462
So, Bernadette doesn't mind?

373
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:35,397
It was her idea!

374
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:41,036
So it's sort of like
a guitar string,

375
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:43,005
but instead of making
an actual sound,

376
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:45,207
each vibration is
a different particle.

377
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:48,811
Precisely. And when
you express it in 11 dimensions,

378
00:17:48,813 --> 00:17:50,713
Einstein's relativity equations
pop out.

379
00:17:50,715 --> 00:17:52,348
Does that sound
like a coincidence?

380
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,149
It does not.
Yup.

381
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:56,385
That's what I think.

382
00:17:56,387 --> 00:17:59,688
So, so, did we do it?
Did we just solve string theory?

383
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,056
Oh.

384
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:02,758
I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

385
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,627
but this is not
the sort of thing

386
00:18:04,629 --> 00:18:06,295
we can figure
out in a night.

387
00:18:06,297 --> 00:18:08,764
People have been
stuck on this for decades.

388
00:18:08,766 --> 00:18:10,099
Well, decades? Really?

389
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:13,002
It's-it's a string.
How hard can it be?

390
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:15,304
It's straight, it's in a loop,

391
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:17,506
it gets knotted up
with other strings. Uh...

392
00:18:17,508 --> 00:18:19,274
Well, actually
there are no knots

393
00:18:19,276 --> 00:18:21,010
in anything greater
than four dimensions.

394
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:23,112
Ooh, unless

395
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:27,850
we get around that by
considering them as sheets.

396
00:18:27,852 --> 00:18:29,718
You know,
topologically speaking,

397
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,921
that has a lot
of interesting possibilities.

398
00:18:32,923 --> 00:18:35,858
See? How long did that take me,
like a minute?

399
00:18:41,298 --> 00:18:42,598
Thought you were
getting us dinner.

400
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,266
Sorry.
I had to stop at Sheldon's

401
00:18:44,268 --> 00:18:46,502
and help him solve
string theory.

402
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:52,975
What?

403
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:56,111
Yeah, turns out
the answer's knots.

404
00:18:56,113 --> 00:18:58,013
That's cute,
but you can't have knots

405
00:18:58,015 --> 00:18:59,481
in more than four dimensions.

406
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:02,718
Mm, you can if
you consider them sheets.

407
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,420
Good night.

408
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,351
What up,
my Hebrews and She-brews?!

409
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:20,456
We are Footprints
on the Moon.

410
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:23,358
Toby, today you are a man,

411
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,961
and you will face
many obstacles in life.

412
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:29,998
And some of those obstacles
are gonna feel like boulders.

413
00:19:31,602 --> 00:19:34,636
This first song is about
the greatest boulder

414
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:37,206
